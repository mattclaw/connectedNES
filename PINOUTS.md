# Pinouts
Care should be taken to correctly verify the pinout for your cable since many
diagrams online refer to Nintendo's standard color-coding scheme and the colors
of your cable's wires might map to different pins.

## Official Hardware

If you have an irreparable controller or otherwise do not mind sacrificing one for
this project, refer to the below table when wiring up the controller cable to your
Particle Photon or other device. Do note that a third party extension cable can be
found for less than 10 American dollars shipped, so it is wholly unnecessary to
destory a working original.

## Third-Party Extension Cables
Extension cables can be a convenient source of NES controller connectors for
this project. They are still mass-produced and easily-found, so you don't
need to sacrifice a controller.
